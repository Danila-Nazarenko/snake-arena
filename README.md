<p>The essence of the Snake game is to control a growing snake on a rectangular grid. The player must maneuver the snake to eat food which appears randomly on the grid. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, making the game more challenging. The rules of the Snake game are quite simple. The player controls the direction of the snake using arrow keys. The snake moves constantly in the chosen direction and cannot stop. The player must navigate the snake to eat the food without hitting the walls or the snake's own body. If the snake collides with any obstacle, the game ends, and the player's score is recorded based on the length of the snake and the number of food items consumed. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by growing the snake as long as possible without colliding with anything.</p>
